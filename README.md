# election_forecast_2018

My main conclusions:
* Democrats take the House, but only by around 10 seats or so.
* Republicans hold the Senate, thanks to the Vice Presidential tiebreaker.

If we want to be specific:
* Democrats take 225 seats in the House
* Democrats take 50 seats in the Senate

Race-by-race findings in Senate:
* All of the usual races (CA, CT, DE, HI, ME, MD, MA, MI, both MN, both MS, NE, NJ, NM, NY, OH, PA, RI, UT, VT, VA, WA, WI, and WY) will go the way they are projected to
* Democratic candidates will win in AZ, FL, IN, MO, MT, NV, and WV
* Republicans will win in ND, TN, and TX, which will be enough to hold the Senate

Race-by-race findings in the House:
* Democrats will win all but one race in NJ, leaving Rep. Chris Smith as the only Republican in their delegation
* Antonio Delgado will win in NY-19
